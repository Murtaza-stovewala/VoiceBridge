## Bridging the Gap Between Eligibility and Access to Government Schemes

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Governments provide hundreds of welfare schemes, yet millions of eligible citizens fail to receive benefits.

While platforms like official scheme portals exist, they assume that users can:

- Read and understand complex information
- Fill digital forms confidently
- Possess correct documents
- Know what to do after rejection

In reality, many citizens — especially first-time applicants, elderly individuals, migrants, and low-literacy users — get stuck after eligibility due to confusion, document issues, or lack of guidance.

As a result, eligibility does not translate into access.

### 💡 Our Solution

Voice of the Unregistered is a voice-first, AI-assisted web platform that helps eligible citizens identify why they are stuck and guides them step-by-step toward successfully accessing government schemes.

Instead of only listing schemes, we focus on execution support:

- Diagnosing application blockers
- Explaining requirements in simple, local language
- Guiding users on the next actionable step

We do not replace government portals — we bridge citizens to them.

### 🎯 Key Features

#### 🎤 Voice-First Interaction

- Users can speak naturally in their local language
- No long forms, dropdowns, or complex text
- Designed for low digital literacy

#### 🧠 Blocker Diagnosis (Core Innovation)

The system identifies why a user is stuck, such as:

- Missing or expired documents
- Incorrect application flow
- Bank or identity mismatches
- Rejection due to misunderstanding

It then explains what went wrong and what to do next.

#### 🗣️ Local Language & Human Explanation

- Converts legal and bureaucratic terms into simple language
- Uses examples and conversational guidance
- Reduces fear of government processes

#### 🔐 Privacy-First & Ethical Design

- No data selling
- No impersonation of government services
- Consent-based interactions
- Designed to assist, not surveil

### 🏆 What Makes This Project Different (USP)

Existing portals tell users what schemes exist.
**We help users who are already eligible actually succeed in getting benefits.**

Our focus is execution, not discovery.
